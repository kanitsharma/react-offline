If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 13 */,\n/* 14 */,\n/* 15 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = function _has(prop, obj) {\n  return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop);\n};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 16 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nvar _curry2 = __webpack_require__(0);\nvar _dispatchable = __webpack_require__(8);\nvar _map = __webpack_require__(91);\nvar _reduce = __webpack_require__(19);\nvar _xmap = __webpack_require__(478);\nvar curryN = __webpack_require__(12);\nvar keys = __webpack_require__(24);\n\n\n/**\n * Takes a function and\n * a [functor](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor),\n * applies the function to each of the functor's values, and returns\n * a functor of the same shape.\n *\n * Ramda provides suitable `map` implementations for `Array` and `Object`,\n * so this function may be applied to `[1, 2, 3]` or `{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`.\n *\n * Dispatches to the `map` method of the second argument, if present.\n *\n * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.\n *\n * Also treats functions as functors and will compose them together.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category List\n * @sig Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n * @param {Function} fn The function to be called on every element of the input `list`.\n * @param {Array} list The list to be iterated over.\n * @return {Array} The new list.\n * @see R.transduce, R.addIndex\n * @example\n *\n *      var double = x => x * 2;\n *\n *      R.map(double, [1, 2, 3]); //=> [2, 4, 6]\n *\n *      R.map(double, {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}); //=> {x: 2, y: 4, z: 6}\n * @symb R.map(f, [a, b]) = [f(a), f(b)]\n * @symb R.map(f, { x: a, y: b }) = { x: f(a), y: f(b) }\n * @symb R.map(f, functor_o) = functor_o.map(f)\n */\nmodule.exports = _curry2(_dispatchable(['fantasy-land/map', 'map'], _xmap, function map(fn, functor) {\n  switch (Object.prototype.toString.call(functor)) {\n    case '[object Function]':\n      return curryN(functor.length, function() {\n        return fn.call(this, functor.apply(this, arguments));\n      });\n    case '[object Object]':\n      return _reduce(function(acc, key) {\n        acc[key] = fn(functor[key]);\n        return acc;\n      }, {}, keys(functor));\n    default:\n      return _map(fn, functor);\n  }\n}));\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 17 */,\n/* 18 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\nvar _curry2 = __webpack_require__(0);\nvar _equals = __webpack_require__(453);\n\n\n/**\n * Returns `true` if its arguments are equivalent, `false` otherwise.
